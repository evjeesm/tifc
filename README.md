## Concept

It is basically a TUI framework that supports infinite 2d space.
Can be thought of as a minimal version of today's mind mapping editors.

## Motivation

I wanted to introduce my self into event based systems and ui's,
as well as improve my C skills. Furthermore, I will test usability
of some other libraries that I am developing in parallel.

## Features
- Unicode support
- Mouse support


## Future Plans
- Make it generic library for tui applications as replacement for curses-like.

## Build
```
./rebuild-modules.sh fresh
./rebuild-modules.sh update
./rebuild-modules.sh config
./rebuild-modules.sh make
./build.sh compile
```
For clean

```
./build.sh clean
```
